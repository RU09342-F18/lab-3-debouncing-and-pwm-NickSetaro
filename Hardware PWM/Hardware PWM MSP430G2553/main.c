 * @version 10.4.2018
 *
 * This code uses a timer to create a pwm signal. This signal drives the LED and controls its brightness.
 * When the button is pressed the duty cycle of the pwm is increased by 10% until it reaches 100%.
 * If the button is pressed at 100% duty cycle the duty cycle is reset to 0%.
