 *
 *This code uses a timer to drive a pwm signal to an LED to control the brightness. A button is then used to increase the duty cycle
 *by 10% or reset to 0% if its already at 100%. The button is debounced using another timer. This button disables its interrupt when it is pressed
 *and turns the timer on. The timer then re-enables the button interrupt after a delay debouncing the button.
