# Hardware PWM
The brightness of an LED can be adjusted by changing the duty cycle of the pulse that is driving the LED. As the duty cycle is increased it increases the brightness of the LED. This code uses a button that increases the duty cycle by 10% each press, therefor increasing the brightness of the LED by 10% each press. This is done by setting the timer to set/reset mode which allows a timer interrupt to occur twice at different intervals creating a different duty cycle.
